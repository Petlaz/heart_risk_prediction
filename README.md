## 🔬 Research Achievements

### 📈 Model Performance Analysis
| Model | F1-Score | Sensitivity | Specificity | Clinical Status |
|-------|----------|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Adaptive_Ensemble** | **0.175** | 14.3% | 98.4% | Best performance |
| Optimal_Hybrid | 0.091 | 5.4% | 99.1% | Extremely conservative |
| Adaptive_LR | 0.032 | 1.8% | 99.4% | Clinically unusable |

### 🎯 Key Findings
- **📊 Performance Gap**: Significant disparity vs. published benchmarks (0.65-0.92 F1) 
- **🏥 Clinical Safety**: All models fail deployment criteria (≥80% sensitivity required)
- **🧬 Feature Analysis**: BMI (0.0208) and Physical Activity (0.0189) top predictors
- **⚠️ Medical Risk**: 822 missed cases per 8,476 patients represents unacceptable clinical risk

### 💡 Clinical Implications
