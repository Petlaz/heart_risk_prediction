# Biweekly Meeting 4 - Heart Risk Prediction Project

**Date:** January 9, 2026  
**Duration:** 1 hour  
**Attendees:** Research Team, Supervisor, Industry Partner

## Sprint 7-8 Progress Summary - Interactive Application Development

### Agenda
- Week 7-8 Gradio application demonstration
- Professional interface implementation review
- Deployment readiness assessment
- Clinical integration pathway discussion

### Progress Updates

#### Completed Tasks ✅
- [x] **Professional Gradio Interface**: "Heart Disease Risk Prediction App" with medical-grade styling
- [x] **Model Integration**: Successfully integrated Adaptive_Ensemble VotingClassifier
- [x] **Real-time Predictions**: Sub-second risk assessment with probability scoring
- [x] **Clinical Recommendations**: Evidence-based lifestyle and medical guidance system
- [x] **Deployment Infrastructure**: Docker containerization with local/public URL sharing
- [x] **Safety Compliance**: Comprehensive medical disclaimers and professional consultation guidance
- [x] **Feature Engineering**: 22-feature input system with automated BMI calculation
- [x] **Risk Stratification**: Three-tier classification (Low/Moderate/High) with clinical interpretation

#### Technical Achievements
- **Application URLs**: Local (http://localhost:7860) and Public (https://409bf8393229402985.gradio.live)
- **Model Performance**: Integrated trained VotingClassifier with 77-78% risk probability consistency
- **User Experience**: Professional interface with comprehensive health assessment forms
- **Error Handling**: Robust fallback systems and user-friendly error messages
- **Cross-platform**: Confirmed compatibility on macOS with Python 3.13

#### Clinical Implementation Insights
- **XAI Integration**: SHAP-informed feature importance analysis in user interface
- **Professional Standards**: Medical-grade disclaimers and ethical implementation guidelines
- **Deployment Readiness**: Complete containerization ready for healthcare environment testing
- **Safety Considerations**: Clear guidance about research vs. clinical grade assessment

#### Key Findings from Implementation
- **Consistent with Previous Analysis**: High risk predictions (77-78%) confirm Week 5-6 optimization paradox findings
- **Interface Validation**: Professional app successfully demonstrates practical healthcare ML implementation
- **Clinical Reality**: Application reveals fundamental limitation of lifestyle survey data for cardiac prediction
- **Deployment Challenge**: Models remain unsuitable for clinical use despite professional interface implementation

### Decisions Made
- **Week 7-8 Status**: COMPLETED with fully functional professional application
- **Deployment Approach**: Docker-ready application suitable for research demonstration
- **Clinical Pathway**: Application serves as proof-of-concept for XAI integration methodology
- **Documentation Focus**: Emphasize honest assessment of healthcare ML implementation challenges
