# Project Plan and Roadmap - Heart Risk Prediction with Explainable AI

**Updated Research Project Plan**

## Project Overview

### Project Title
Prediction and Local Explainable AI (XAI) in Healthcare

### Project Duration
**Start Date:** October 2025  
**End Date:** January 2026  
**Total Duration:** 3 months

### Team
**Supervisor:** Prof. Dr. Beate Rhein  
**Industry Partner:** Nightingale Heart – Mr. Håkan Lane  
**Researcher:** [Your Name]

### Project Goal
The goal is to integrate **Local Explainable AI (XAI) techniques** — specifically **LIME and SHAP** — to interpret model decisions at the individual level.

A **Gradio interface** will provide real-time interactive predictions and explanations.  
The entire workflow will be **containerized using Docker** for reproducibility and future deployment.

## Dataset Overview

**Structured CSV dataset** with health, demographic, and lifestyle variables.

- **Target variable:** `hltprhc` (heart condition: 1 = yes, 0 = no)
- **Alternative targets:** `hltprhb` (blood pressure), `hltprdi` (diabetes)

## Research Objectives

1. **Develop and compare predictive models:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, and PyTorch Neural Network.
2. **Perform early error analysis** (accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix, and misclassified samples).
3. **Conduct model optimization and iterative validation** on unseen data after tuning.
4. **Apply Local Explainability** (LIME and SHAP) for individual-level interpretation.
5. **Conduct a literature review** ("State of the Art") informed by model errors.
6. **Write report sections** (Methods, Results, Discussion) in parallel with experiments.
7. **Build a Gradio demo** for interpretable healthcare prediction.
8. **Containerize all experiments** using Docker for reproducibility.
