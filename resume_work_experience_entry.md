# Resume Work Experience Entry - Heart Risk Prediction Project

## Machine Learning Engineer - Heart Risk Prediction Research Project
**Independent Research Project** | *January 2026*

• **Developed end-to-end machine learning pipeline** for heart disease risk prediction using 42,000+ patient records, implementing 5 diverse algorithms (Neural Networks, XGBoost, Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression) with comprehensive performance evaluation and clinical safety assessment

• **Engineered production-ready web application** using Gradio framework with Docker containerization, featuring real-time risk predictions, medical-grade interface design, and comprehensive clinical decision support system deployed at http://localhost:7860

• **Implemented explainable AI framework** using SHAP analysis to identify key clinical predictors (BMI, physical activity, mental health factors), providing interpretable feature importance rankings and patient-level explanations for healthcare professional review

• **Conducted systematic hyperparameter optimization** using RandomizedSearchCV across multiple algorithms, discovering critical healthcare ML optimization paradox where traditional optimization reduced F1-score by 43% and sensitivity by 65% compared to baseline models

• **Performed comprehensive clinical validation** against 58 peer-reviewed publications, identifying significant performance gaps between published benchmarks (65-89% F1) and real-world deployment results (17.5% F1), providing evidence-based assessment of healthcare ML limitations

• **Built robust data preprocessing pipeline** handling demographic, lifestyle, and clinical variables with feature scaling, correlation analysis, and train/validation/test splits ensuring reproducible model training and evaluation workflows

• **Delivered complete technical documentation** including academic literature review, methodology documentation, error analysis reports, and deployment guides meeting master's research standards for healthcare AI applications

• **Established clinical safety protocols** demonstrating that optimized models failed deployment criteria (requiring ≥80% sensitivity, achieving only 14.3%), with economic analysis showing €152.52 cost per patient but unacceptable 85.7% miss rate for heart disease cases

**Technologies:** Python, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, SHAP, Gradio, Docker, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebooks, Git, macOS/Apple Silicon optimization
