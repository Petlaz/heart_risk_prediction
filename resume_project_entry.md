# Resume Project Entry - Heart Risk Prediction Project

## Heart Disease Risk Prediction with Explainable AI
**Machine Learning Research Project** | *January 2026*  
**GitHub:** [Repository Link] | **Live Demo:** http://localhost:7860

• **Designed and implemented comprehensive ML pipeline** processing 42,000+ patient health records with 5-algorithm comparison (Neural Networks, XGBoost, Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression) achieving 30.8% F1-score baseline performance

• **Built production-ready web application** using Gradio framework with Docker containerization, featuring real-time heart disease risk assessment, medical-grade UI, and clinical decision support system

• **Applied explainable AI techniques** using SHAP analysis to identify key health predictors (BMI, physical activity, mental health) with feature importance visualization and patient-level prediction explanations

• **Conducted hyperparameter optimization** across multiple algorithms using RandomizedSearchCV, discovering optimization paradox where traditional tuning reduced model sensitivity by 65% compared to baseline models

• **Performed clinical validation study** benchmarking against 58 peer-reviewed publications, identifying 75% performance gap between published results and real-world deployment scenarios

• **Engineered robust data preprocessing pipeline** with feature scaling, correlation analysis, and stratified train/validation/test splits ensuring reproducible model training workflows

• **Implemented comprehensive error analysis** revealing systematic model failures and clinical safety assessment showing 85.7% miss rate for heart disease cases, demonstrating deployment challenges

• **Delivered complete technical documentation** including literature review, methodology reports, and deployment guides meeting academic research standards for healthcare AI applications

**Technologies:** Python, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, SHAP, Gradio, Docker, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebooks

**Key Achievements:**
- Processed 42,000+ patient records with clinical-grade data preprocessing
- Achieved Docker deployment with production-ready containerization
- Identified critical gaps in healthcare ML performance vs. literature claims
- Demonstrated XAI integration for clinical interpretability
